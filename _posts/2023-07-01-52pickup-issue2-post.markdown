Issue 2 (May 2023) of 52 Pickup is our first Cocktail Edition, which contains three cocktails inspired by board games that we believe will pair very well with the play experience.

## The Drinks

### Terragroni
Pairs with [Terraforming Mars (Jacob Fryxelius, 2016)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars).
This drink is a twist on a Negroni, using an Elderflower ice cube and shifting the ingredients to create a drink that terraforms as you consume it. It transitions from more dry and bitter flavors to something sweeter and floral.

### Sushi Go-Tini
Pairs with [Sushi Go! (Phil Walker-Harding, 2013)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go).
For this drink, I wanted to create something that captures the essence of sushi. I decided to use a Martini as a base because, like sushi, it relies on bringing out the best in a small number of ingredients. In this drink, the stars are Sake and homemade wasabi-infused Vodka, which come together to create a surprisingly accessible drink.

### Bourbon Bumper-Car
Pairs with [Dice Dodgems (Dylan Byrne, 2021)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/331051/dice-dodgems).
With this drink, I focused on matching the experience of making it with the experience of playing the game. By basing the drink on a fruity version of a Whiskey Smash, it maintains the essence of the game while also encouraging you to "bump" some lemon around in the shaker.
