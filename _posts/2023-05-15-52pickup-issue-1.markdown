Issue 1 (April 2023) of 52 Pickup is our first Standard Playing Card Edition, which contains two games you can play with a standard deck (or decks) of playing cards.

## The Games

### Escape the Pet Shop!
A co-op game for 1-2 players where you attempt to escape a Pet Shop by evading its owner! It contains elements of set collection, grid movement, and hand management.

### It Approaches!
Something diabolical draws near. Out-bluff your opponents to keep your best resources before IT APPROACHES! A game for 2-4+ players per deck of cards. It contains elements of bluffing and memory.

## Designer Notes

### Escape the Pet Shop!
Escape the Pet Shop! is my attempt to simplify some of my favorite mechanics in co-op games, making it playable with a standard deck of cards. I believe there is plenty of opportunity for expansion, such as introducing character abilities for the players and bringing in a custom deck with art. You may see further development in this space.

The main games that inspired me were [Forbidden Desert (Matt Leacock, 2013)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136063/forbidden-desert) and [Transformers: The Deck Building Game (Dan Blanchette, Matt Hyra, 2021)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/337961/transformers-deck-building-game).

### It Approaches!
It Approaches was designed to fit in the simplest of spaces, where you can play with a group of people at a very low skill level. My intention was to create a party game that still involves a bit of skill and strategy, rather than relying solely on luck.

The main games that inspired me were [Get Bit! (Dave Chalker, 2007)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30539/get-bit), Poker, and Liar's Dice.
