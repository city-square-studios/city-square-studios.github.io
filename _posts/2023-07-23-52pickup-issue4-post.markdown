## The Game
### Goblin Dungeon
A solitaire roll and write game where you build a dungeon, fill it with goblins, and set dastardly traps to try keep those greedy adventurers away from your trinkets! Also contains bonus rules for hero units and a competitive multiplayer variant.

## Designer Notes

### Goblin Dungeon
I designed this game around capturing the feeling from playing classic 'choose your own adventure' books and classic Games Workshop/Steve Jackson games, while adding a base building element. In the inspirations it's usually the player in conflict with space, trying to get to the end of a path to win the game. So in order to achieve my design goals I inverted this trope; the player creates the space and the conflict comes from stopping an outside force from reaching the end.

In keeping with the inspirations, the game is stacked a bit against the player, but there are plenty of ways to adjust difficulty.

The main games that inspired me was the [Fighting Fantasy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140480/pyramid) series, [Chainsaw Warrior](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1827/chainsaw-warrior), and [Munchkin](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1927/munchkin).
