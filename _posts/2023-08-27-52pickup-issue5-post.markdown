Issue 5 (August 2023) of 52 Pickup is our Tabletop Role-Playing Game Edition, which contains a game you can play with a pencil, paper, and a standard deck of cards.

## The Game

In this game the company you all work for is going through a merger, and the CEO is going to pick who makes it through with their job intact. Grovel, manipulate, and put in extra hours to outperform the other employees, but don’t put too many spanners in the works else you’ll all be fired!

## Designer Notes

I had a few objectives when creating Merger; experiment with a standard card-based system for a TTRPG, create a TTRPG with inter-party conflict that can still drive the action forward, and build it all around an unusual theme.

Originally this game’s central premise was that it was the TTRPG your fantasy TTRPG characters play when they want escapism. After play testing the system however it became clear it could stand as a premise of it’s own.

The main games I used for inspiration were [Paranoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)), [Powered by the Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse) systems, and the [World Wide Wrestling RPG](https://ndpdesign.com/wwwrpg).
