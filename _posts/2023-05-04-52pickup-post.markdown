52 Pickup is an irregularly published Zine for board game, card game, and adjacent content. Issues can include things like standard playing card games, micro board games, and other content inspired by games.

## Why?
Creating board games generally takes a long time, between designing, developing, play testing, manufacturing, and publishing you can be working on the same project for over a year. However what if during this process you keep having ideas, but don’t want to have several large projects on the go at once?

Well, in our case, you throw all these ideas together into micro magazines to get them out of your head while working on the main grind. These ideas won’t be as polished as main projects, but look to explore mechanics on a smaller scale on a much faster timeframe.

## What?
52 Pickup has several aims as a Zine: 

### 1. **Be board/card game inspired**

- Not every issue will contain games, but every issues content will be inspired by games

### 2. **Explore ideas at a small scale**

- Content will be contained within the Zine and won’t require readers to go searching in other places

### 3. **Content is generally accessible**

- Games printed will aim to be playable with standard playing cards, six sided dice,
household items, or what’s in the Zine, staying away from special components

## What’s in a name?
52 Pickup is inspired by the joke card game where you throw a deck of cards on the floor and then have to pick everything up again. Just like it’s namesake 52 Pickup the Zine attempts to through a bunch of ideas on the floor where you can choose which ones look interesting to pick up.

## How will it be made available?
We’re still exploring how we make these available to people. We’re currently bringing physical copies in conventions we’re attending, but in the future we’ll look at making these available digitally and/or posting physical issues or collections.
